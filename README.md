# A 3SUM algorithm on the binary addition level of atomic generated real numbers

Preprint, id: paper_0003

## Abstract
*We present a simple algorithm for the 3SUM problem for a list L of n real numbers. For this, we generate real numbers with the help of a set I_{a} of so called 'Atomic irrational numbers'. We can show that our algorithm, which use the binary representation of integers, takes time complexity O(nb + U^{1.58}) for an universe of U := 2^{b} distinguishable rational numbers and with our so generated real numbers it takes a time complexity of O(nb|I_{a}| + U^{1.58}\_{I_{a}}) on an universe of U_{I_{a}} := 2^{b |I_{a}|} distinguishable real numbers.*
