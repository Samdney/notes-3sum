# A 3SUM algorithm on the binary addition level of numbers

Preprint, id: paper_0003

## Abstract
*We present a simple algorithm for the 3SUM problem for a list L of n real numbers. For this, we
use the binary representation b of the given numbers and basic properties of binary addition by going
through the addition of three numbers bit by bit.*
